\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we try to introduce RRAM into CNN accelerator on-chip buffer design. The accumulation buffer is introduced to relief the I/O energy overhead brought by RRAM. A set of schedule strategy optimizations is proposed to fully utilize the high storage density of RRAM. Experimental results show that by combining the hardware and software optimization and do design space exploration, $25\%\sim 98\%$ DRAM access energy and $86\%$ on-chip buffer energy can be saved. RRAM based design achieves 18$\%$ less system energy compared with an SRAM based design. Future work should focus on the rest part of the energy cost like the standby energy and the computation energy.
